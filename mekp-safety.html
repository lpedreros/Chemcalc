            <h2>Handling and Storage</h2>
            <p>Eliminate all ignition sources from the area. For spills, use inert, damp, non-combustible material for clean-up.</p>
            
            <h2>First Aid Measures</h2>
            <p>In case of eye or skin contact, flush with water and seek medical attention immediately. For inhalation, move to fresh air and seek medical attention. Do not induce vomiting if ingested.</p>
            
            <h2>Exposure Controls/Personal Protection</h2>
            <p>Wear appropriate protective clothing, including eye protection. Ensure availability of eyewash and quick drench facilities.</p>
            
            <h2>Fire Fighting Measures</h2>
            <p>In case of fire involving MEKp, use water spray to extinguish. Avoid exposure to heat and sunlight.</p>

            <h2>Storage and Disposal</h2>
            <p>Store in closed bottles, away from light. Diluted solutions are more stable. Dispose of MEKp safely using reducing agents.</p>

            <h2>Special Notes</h2>
            <p>MEKp is a sensitive explosive and a strong irritant. Handle with care and follow all safety guidelines.</p>
