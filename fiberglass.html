    <h2>Quality Repairs, Expert Guidance & Recurring Training</h2>
    <p>
      With years of hands-on experience, I not only deliver top-quality structural and cosmetic repairs on boats using fiberglass, Divinycel, Coosa Board, Starboard, Starlite, nidacore, wood, and more—but I also teach you how to do it yourself. Whether you're interested in live, hands-on training sessions, tele-guiding, or comprehensive premium courses, I offer personalized guidance to help you master every repair project with confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use only the highest quality materials—polyester, vinylester, epoxy, expanding foam, Awlgrip, and more—to ensure every repair is built to last. And if you’re eager to get started on your project immediately, ask about our specially curated kit subscriptions that provide all the necessary items right to your doorstep.
